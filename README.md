# Grade Calculator +

A simple, interactive web app designed for students to calculate their grades and set goals for improvement.  
Created by **Adam Chen-Kang Lee** for the **2025 Congressional App Challenge**.

----------

## Overview

**Grade Calculator +** helps satudents quickly determine their current grade and see what score they need on future assignments to reach  target.  
It uses **formative and summative weight categories** (customizable) to mirror typical middle school and high school grading systems.

----------

## Features

-   Add assignments as `score/total` for each category.
    
-   Automatically computes your weighted final grade.
    
-   Adjust weights for formative and summative scores.
    
-   Set a **target grade** and instantly calculate the **score needed** on your next assignment.
    
-   Clean, dark-themed interface with smooth animations.
    

----------

## How It Works

Built entirely using:

-   **HTML** for structure
    
-   **CSS** for dark theme and layout
    
-   **JavaScript** for calculations and interactivity
    

No frameworks or libraries are required — it runs directly in your browser!

----------

## Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
    
2.  Enter your **formative** and **summative** assignment weights.
    
3.  Add assignments using the format `x/y` (e.g., `17/20`).
    
4.  Click **“Calculate Final Grade.”**
    
5.  Use the **Grade Goal Calculator** to find out what you need to reach your target grade.
    

----------

## Example

If your formative weight is **20%** and summative is **80%**, and you’ve entered:

-   Formative: `18/20`
    
-   Summative: `80/100`
    

Your calculated final grade will appear instantly.

## Inspiration

I wanted to create a tool that helps students like understand their grades more clearly and plan for success.  
Many online grade calculators are dated or simple— this project focuses on simplicity, math accuracy, and clean design.
